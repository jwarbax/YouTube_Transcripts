I started designing an ITB intake system for my Miata race car and since then it's sort of evolved and taken on a whole life of its own and because of a decision I made two years ago to introduce myself to this guy at Willow Springs you might recognize him he only has like I don't know 8 million subscribers on YouTube I now have this huge super fancy 3D printer getting shipped to my shop I'm going to go over all the details between point a and point B later on in the video but for right now let's look at some intake designs so do any viewers that are new to the channel thank you for tuning in this is the third video in a series so if you don't want to get ahead of yourself you can go ahead and get your meat and potatoes up here in the corner and come back for dessert if you have seen the other two videos you'll recognize this Venturi system vacuum tube design that I was working on so a couple of you guys pointed out that the tube's quite small so it's not going to be able to move very much air which I agree with also one of the problems that I made when I designed this thing is I made the nipple 11 millimeters which no hose fits so that was my fault but there are a couple of other issues that I want to point out that make me not want to go this route but don't be dismayed there is still hope for the multi-linked runner design and I'll get to that in a minute so one of the issues is the air has to pass around the vacuum tubes themselves because they're inside of the air box so that creates an obstruction and it's going to create turbulence because whoa I'm okay so this is what the tubes are going to look like inside of the air box and the air has to go around these things it's going to Tumble it's going to create turbulence it's not going to get a smooth flow of air through the runners the other issue is the diameter of the choked off portion itself I mentioned how this diameter times four is still more surface area than the diameter of the original stock throttle body so at stock power levels it wouldn't create a restriction but at some horsepower level it's going to create a restriction and I don't know exactly what that is but it's going to be a lower horsepower level than this would create a restriction if I kept the diameter that it will enter the throttle body I do agree with those of you that said that this tube is not big enough to have any significant effect on power levels so what are we going to do we're going to do what some of you have also suggested and make it an electromechanical system so the air in this design is going to enter the manifold right before it all goes into the intake valve and the tubes themselves are going to be bypassing the throttle bodies completely which will make them as short as they can possibly be I've also increased the diameter of these tubes to save 15 millimeters or 5 8 something like that so that you can have a more substantial airflow going through them it'll make more of an impact at high RPM which is what we're hoping for but the valves the solenoids they can be closed at low RPM so you get the full performance benefit of the long Runner I think this way right here is probably the better way to do it so the control system will look something like this where it looks at the RPM of the engine and the throttle position and if they both meet the requirement it'll open the valve so you get that high RPM benefit and I also think it'd be a good idea to have some sort of Fail-Safe in the design so if the valve gets stuck open for some reason if the computer sees that the throttle position is low and it's not getting any vacuum it's just going to cut the engine off completely so it doesn't run away the whole reason I'm doing this in the first place which is connecting cylinder one to cylinder three and connecting each cylinder to the next one that's going to call for air is because I'm hoping that it's going to create more of a uniform flow inside the air box itself what happens when the intake valve closes it pushes all the air back out of the Velocity stack that it was coming through and the air changes Direction inside of the air box so I'm hoping by creating more of a gradual transition from one cylinder to the next it's going to keep the air in more of a constant motion so many of you have pointed out how a 180 degree Bend in the intake runner it's not a good thing I recognize that but I want to keep the bend because I want to keep the runner as long as possible and I want it to fit in a certain external Dimension so it fits underneath the hood so what I'm doing is I'm redesigning the plenum to give that air as easy of a passage to make that turn as I can possibly give it so you can kind of see what's going on here I'm trying to give the air a constant circular pattern so that it doesn't have to change directions as it goes into that velocity stack so most of the air is going to come in the plenum and go straight up into the velocity stack like so now the air that doesn't make it into the velocity stack as soon as it comes into the plenum is going to slip by on the outside and on the outside it starts off with a small Gap and ends with a large gap and I'm hoping that by slowing the air down as it makes this turn I can have the air attach itself to these surfaces and be able to make that turn without creating too much restriction or turbulence will it work in practice I don't know another interesting feature that this design has created is this as the air comes in from the secondary Runner it's going to mix with air going a different direction and because these two bits of air are going two different directions they're going to start a tumble we're going to create a bit of turbulence and hopefully that turbulence coming in right before the injector sprays will create a better mixture between the air and the fuel this is the top view of the type of circular motion that I want to see inside the air box so as the air comes up through this small Gap it's going to be able to wrap around the outside of the runner and come back in change direction and go back in the other way so everything in this plenum is designed so that the air can be constantly rotating and not going straight and changing direction so uh I don't really know a whole lot of math formulas but I do know air air goes straight good air move fast good so that's what I'm basing it on I want to be transparent with you guys about myself for a moment so I dropped out of high school when I was 16. I didn't do too well in school I didn't get my high school diploma I've since gotten my GED that was about a year ago but despite not doing too well at school I've always been passionate about learning and passionate about education and I don't want any of this to come across as a slam to higher education because I firmly believe that education is one of the most important elements of our modern society but I know there's a lot of you guys out there like me for one reason or another just have a hard time succeeding at school despite having a passion for learning school's just hard for some people because everybody's different so all this is really to say that you guys are awesome because you've given me so much clarity about where this channel is going because I have ideas that I'm really protective of ideas that I was basing products and whole businesses around but after sharing this idea with you guys and seeing the kind of interaction I'm getting with the community I want to share all of my ideas with you guys on YouTube because I think Prada trucks are cool and businesses are cool but learning is even cooler so since I'm obviously learning as I go I want you guys to have the same opportunity to learn what I'm learning there's super big updates coming some just later on in this video and then even more in videos to come so if that sounds like a journey that you want to be a part of I'd recommend getting subscribed so how did meeting Nolan Sykes from donut media lead to me getting a crazy nice 3D printer so a couple years ago I was at Willow Springs I was doing spec Miata at the time I hadn't got into endurance yet and I saw Nolan he was just chilling watching watching the cars go by talking with the people that he was helping at the time and I recognize this face I you know got I was like Zach is that the dude got a little closer I'm like no I think that's that's Nolan dude that's Nolan this was internal dialogue hopefully I don't know maybe I was mumbling anyway so I went up to him I introduced myself asked him what he was up to there I got to chat with him and the team that he was helping for a little bit no one was going to be spotting for this endurance team and I was super interested in helping on an endurance team because I was thinking of doing endurance myself so I wanted to get some experience so I asked them if they needed any help and they said they're actually one guy short they needed someone to hold the fire extinguisher and I was like perfectly qualified to hold a fire extinguisher generally like creating fires more than I like putting them out but I think given the opportunity I think I'd put a fire out most likely so I got to meet all the members of the endurance team it was really easy to remember their names because everyone was named Peter which was interesting I thought it was some kind of requirement or something to be on the team but yeah that was a thing no but the team itself is called Technic competition and what they do is actually really cool they're a 501c3 charity and they're in the business of helping people get education get better careers even start businesses they want to use the Motorsport Community as a learning tool and also as a recipient of putting back into the community the skills and the value that they've created in individuals lives as they've helped educate them so I hope Technic a few more times with some of their endurance races but fast forward to just a few months ago and head honcho Peter hooked me up with the student named Owen now Owen's been 3D printing for a long time he's going to school to be a design engineer and he wants to start a 3D printing business so him and I got to sharing some ideas with each other we took our ideas to Peter which we're about starting a 3D printing business and he really liked the idea he wanted to invest so now as part of Technic we have access to a huge CNC routing table a 3D scanner and pretty soon a massive 3d printer as well it's a modix big 60. it's about two feet by two feet by two feet really monstrous machine so the amount of items that we're going to be able to produce with these things is pretty huge there have been some people that have reached out to us already I designed and printed a AFM delete tube for a 1.6 liter Miata we're designing a window bracket for a Porsche 356 race car we have a super cool off-road light down in the video's description and we're building brackets for different models specific race cars and off-road trucks to make it a quick bolt-in solution so you don't have to make your own bracket or drill holes where you don't want to so because the large format 3D printer isn't here yet there are certain things we can't make right now but feel free to reach out because we can still model and we can still print things that are maybe slightly smaller in dimensions on the smaller printers that we do have so now back to the printed intake system let's talk about some problems so these listed are obstacles that I'm currently facing with the Prototype print maybe some of these will be relieved with the higher quality 3D printer but let's go over see what we're dealing with the ASA I'm not a huge fan of because it seems to separate between the layers it seems to be a problem with the material itself because I've seen other articles online talking about it so that might not be my ideal material for the plenum the carbon fiber polypropylene on the other hand has excellent layer adhesion but it's super hard to print so as a trade-off isn't it so the problem on the O-ring Groove that most of you are suggesting to me because I might be switching from ASA to a different material for the plenum I don't know if I'll be able to include that Groove in the model I might have to cut it in after it's printed so that would definitely be a challenge but if I can keep the print from warping at the bed level I can include the groove into the product and I won't have to worry about cutting it in afterwards as I talked about in the second video it's really time consuming to take apart so doing multiple Dyno runs is currently a challenge but it's all getting redesigned anyway so that might not be an issue anymore or it might be more of an issue things you learn and the last thing is I was considering thermoforming the upper plenum out of polycarbonate now that the design is more sophisticated than it was before I don't know if that's going to be possible but it would certainly be cool to be able to see the stacks through the plenum so I would like to be able to do that but we'll see how much of a trade-off it's going to be on the design so don't click out just yet there's one thing I wanted to that's two things there's one thing I wanted to point out about donut media before the video is over so it's obvious donut makes really cool car content but what's not so obvious is how they present themselves with this energy that you definitely don't have to come from some Royal racing bloodline or even be a mechanic to think that cars are cool there's so much gatekeeping around certain communities and what donut does really levels the playing field and makes it more accessible for the average person to get into cars and into car culture and enjoy the community that we all love so thank you for what you do donut media I hope you all enjoyed this video and I hope I see you in another [Music]
