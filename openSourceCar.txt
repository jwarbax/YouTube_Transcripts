what if the world had a car that was reliable good on gas low on emissions and cheap to buy emphasis on cheap the least expensive car you can buy here in America is $18,000 new who has $118,000 they can just drop on a new car normally I have to finance it and then four five six years later when the car is paid off and you want to sell it for whatever reason it's worth maybe a quarter of its original value if you ask me the new car industry is kind of a scam it's not always a great decision financially to buy a brand new car so what if we had a car that was so affordable you could buy it outright it saved you money on Transportation cost whether it's gas or hybrid or electric doesn't break and you can use it for a long time it's really simple in concept but pretty ambitious in reality but by making the whole project open source where all the files are available for free and any existing shops or manufacturing facilities can manufacture this thing on their own I think we can blow the doors open on this opportunity and make it a reality welcome to project osaki so I've been developing a lot of concepts for a lot of different experiments and potential products over the years and all these things are very near and dear to my heart and I had hoped to patent them one day but I'm a man of limited resources and I can't afford to patent one of these ideas let alone all hundreds of ideas that come in and out of my mind on a regular basis so I decided to share them with you guys on YouTube in hopes that someone out there can benefit from them that this car can benefit from them and not only this car but I'm sure these things if they turn out to be viable products can have many different applications so that's why I went open source with this thing among these ideas are a gas electric hybrid rotary engine a single rotor wankle with electronic efficiency booster a longitudinally phased electric motor for rear wheeel drive hybrid retrofits a DIY fiberglass infused thermoplastic for inex expensive body panels and a variable diameter intake or exhaust tubing for more efficient combustion and then of course the 3D printed intake manifold for the Miata race car as with any experiments failure is to be expected and whether any of these things can turn into viable products is anybody's guess but something I can tell you for sure is we're going to learn a lot of cool stuff we're going to build a lot of cool stuff and we're going to make sharing ideas contagious because I think that's what the world needs right now so over the coming weeks and months and years each of these ideas and experiments is going to get their own series of videos and in this video I'm going to give a brief overview of each individual thing for you so you know what to expect and with that let's talk about the car design and if I've kept your attention this long please give this video a thumbs up because the better this video spreads the better the chance we have of making this a reality so the first Core Design feature we're talking about today is spacious tandem seating so we're going to make this car as skinny as possible reducing the frontal area as much as we can because according to this formula which calculates the total drag of a vehicle it's actually more effective to reduce the frontal area than it is to lower the CD so it's more effective to make it skinny than it is to make it slippery but we're going to do both anyways which will result in a pretty fuele efficient vehicle I believe but we don't want it to be cramped right it's tandem seating uh it's easy to Envision this as a cramped you know driving compartment passenger compartment we want to keep it spacious so we're not trying to cut the width of a normal car in half we're just trying to reduce it by maybe 35 or 40% that way you retain good Elbow Room leg room head room and it feels like you're in a you know spacious driving environment despite the fact that it's so narrow another cool benefit of having such a narrow vehicle is the concentration of mass so most of the Mass is at the center of the vehicle you'll have drastically less weight transferred to the tires and you can make the tires much more narrow further reducing the frontal area and fuel efficiency of the car but in order to get a little bit better braking performance and cornering performance we can increase the diameter of the wheel to get a little bit more rubber on the road as we're driving let's head on over to the computer where I can show you the 3D model that I've made in blender I am not skilled in surface modeling on a 3D program and you'll see the result of that right now in case it needs to be said this blocky gray model doesn't represent a finished result it's a rough draft just gives us a basic idea of the type of Dimensions we're aiming for so super low frontal area less than that of a sports car but overall it has a larger footprint similar to that of like a midsize sedan or something like that I want to sit the people tandem so front to back instead of side to side because most cars on the road have a single occupant in them so it's a waste of energy to push the air out of the way for an empty compartment when you have side by-side seating I get it this car is a little funny looking right now but I think uh we put some effort into styling we can make this look really cool so there's a cool aspect to this being as it's open source that I wanted to highlight real quick so let's say you're a shop or a facility and you have the means and desire to make this car and you really like the body but you don't like the powertrain so much you can develop your own powertrain keep it proprietary there's no pressure on you to share an open source the way this Project's open source and you can use the body that like for free you don't have to pay anything to use the files they're commercially available the only caveat is if you make some sort of development to the body that makes it more efficient or something like that you just have to share that development data with us the way that we share our development data with you it's a nice little give and take keeps it fair so as you can see the possibilities are virtually endless for this thing it's really exciting and there could potentially be dozens of companies that are making their own variation on this body um that's a little bit more sporty maybe can carry more passengers maybe a little bit more off-road capable it's uh it's really exciting stuff so the second Core Design feature is kind of three points all in one so the first is the inboard brake system I want this type of system on the front and the back um it's just the brakes aren't inside the wheel they're in they're mounted to the frame so by doing that you need to run an axle down to the hub um and it's a little bit of a challenge for the front because it doesn't necessarily need to have an A gearing system or a transaxle or anything unless we make it all-wheel drive which isn't out of the question but it's not a core design feature so this reduces the unsprung weight and not only that but it allows the brake cooling system to be stationary instead of having to be flexible you know to move with the wheel and also it reduces turbulence around the wheel so you can seal that wheel off completely you don't need to use the wheel to cool the brake system uh so you can seal it off and reduce the turbulence around it and lower the CD Point number two on or 2.2 I guess you could say is this entire suspension system should be modular so every corner of the car I want to have the exact same component same brake rotor caliper axle spindle control arms everything so that way it's just cheaper to buy parts it's easier to have Parts availability you know it's just all cost focused stuff um and and then 2.3 on uh the core design feature is this inboard suspension setup so the coil spring and the shock will also be on the inside and this is just to further reduce that frontal area and reduce the unsprung weight so you'll have a nice ride quality because you won't have to move that mass up and down as the car goes over bumps and uneven surfaces and uh yeah it'll probably handle pretty nice too then we come to the most controversial feature of all the powertrain Tree Huggers hate anything that burns gas us knuckle Dragon Grease Monkeys don't like electric cars so how do you please everybody I think it's hybrids I think hybrids are really cool you motorheads might disagree with me but think about it you can get where you're going hear all those lovely sounds of the internal combustion engine save a little bit of gas on the way and have extra torque from your electric assist motor when you need it not a bad Shake in my opinion I think hybrids are the Future Love Me hate me that's the direction we're going for this car so with that let me give you a brief summary of the first three experimental designs that we're working on right now sweet so here we have the humble 12a rotary engine some of you might be wondering why did I choose this engine for our first project osaki powertrain experiment well it's a simple answer it was the only running engine I had to work with so here we are what we're going to do is turn this gas burning rotor into a hybrid electric gas burning rotary we're not taking away any of the fuel burning qualities of this engine we're simply adding a assisting electric motor into this intermediate housing it's going to be an axial flux motor it's going to be reluctance based so there will be no permanent magnets we won't have to worry about crossing the temperature that a permanent magnet will lose its magnetic ability uh because we're only going to be pulling on the steel in the rotors so there are so many questions to answer so many problems that already identified before I started digging into this and we're going to go over all that in a dedicated video on this project uh but for now I'll keep this overview flowing and we'll get right into the uh single rotor experiment that I want to perform so the reason this experiment is only applicable to a single rotor um is because the fact that the second rotor is 180° out of phase um will make it not work so a problem with the rotary engine is incomplete combustion it throws a lot of raw fuel out of the exhaust port and that's why it can't pass emissions right because it doesn't burn all the fuel cuz this combustion chamber is shaped really weird and it's moving away from the flame front and you end up having combustion still occurring by the time oh I'm spinning this the wrong way I actually have this backwards so here's your let's start at the okay so compression just finished right there we're on the power STP stroke so the mixture is exploding in this combustion chamber here the combustion chamber is very quickly moving away from the flame front and by the time the exhaust Port opens the combustion's still occurring and we send a lot of raw fuel out of the exhaust so my theory is what if we had an electric motor maybe similar to the one that we plan to use in the two rotor design or maybe just in an external electric motor doesn't really matter what if we had an electric motor that slowed the rotor down during the power stroke so it kept this rotor moving slow to give the fuel a little bit more time to combust and at the same time as the motor is being used to slow down this rotor it's generating electricity so it's charging the battery it's slowing down the rotor we're getting a more complete burn and hopefully we could save a little fuel while also charging the battery at the same time so the hypothesis is that with a little bit of well-timed speeding up and slowing down of this rotor as it goes through its four stroke combustion cycle we can make it burn cleaner and charge a battery at the same time is it possible I don't know but I think it's worth testing all right guys so hold on to your hats cuz this longitudinally phased electric motor is the creme de Creme of everything that I've been thinking about for like probably the past six six years so hold on to your hats help all right guys this is a conventional synchronous reluctance motor a very simplified orientation so you have your phase one you can see that when Phase One turns on these two electr magnets are connected this bar will want to align itself so that it's lined up with the first phase and then as it rotates around when Phase 2 turns on it'll want to align itself with that so it always stays in sync synchronous to the phase that's on and the number of poles on your rotor normally matches the numbers of poles on your stator although the configurations start to get pretty wild looking when you look at them in practice in principle this is how they operate and this is how my motor is different I'm going to keep it really short and sweet because I'm going to do a full video on it but for now just know that I took the phases which normally go around the circumference of the motor and I made them longitudinal you know across its length that way you can take this upper Stater section and push it up into a drive shaft tunnel and still have great ground clearance way more than you would have if this motor had a full circumference of sters the way a conventional design would work so you can install this in a rear wheeel drive car to make it a hybrid without modifying your floor pan at all so I'm super excited about this I've been working on this idea for a really long time and and very soon you'll have a ful length video on the topic the last two points I want to touch on on the car Overview at least are really simple we can go through them quickly minimal cost adding Tech so not a bunch of gadgets and gizmos and doohickeys on the inside of the Interior we're focused on reducing the costs as much as possible but this is open source so we might try to make the interior modular where other companies can add you know different modules and components to you know give it the tech that they desire uh but for the most part the base model of this car will be very simple inside it'll only have what you need to get from point A to point B and be reliable and last but not least classic styling it's got to look cool I think what some people miss the mark on when they're doing concept cars is they make it so like streamlined and slippery you know you're supposed to follow a teardrop shape to make the car aerodynamically efficient but they make the cars look like an actual teardrop which I think is very uncool so we want to keep little bit of sharp angles or whatever we can do to make the car look visually appealing cuz that's super important for you guys liking it so to demonstrate our last two experiments that we're working on uh the DIY fiberglass I actually already did its first full length video so you can check it out right let's see right here and on the variable diameter intake tubing or exhaust tubing it's something I just freaking thought of recently like last week I think and uh basically let me get a marker I was thinking well what if instead of making an intake tract long for low RPM Performance what if you just decreased the diameter it seems like it'd be more effective how could you do that so I was thinking what if you had a flexible membrane and two Chambers where the outside chamber pressure dictated the diameter of the inside membrane so you have your outside chamber something like this that might be too low let me bring it up oh you know what I drew I drew all this on the other side of the board let me just spin the board

around need to put some new wheels on this it does not spin very well all right so this is our restricted position smaller diameter our wide open position you'll have two Chambers and a flexible membrane the outside chamber you'll will be temp will be pressure adjustable so with less pressure here than here you'll open it up and you'll have a wide open position and when there's more pressure in the top chamber than there is in the middle it'll be restricted and you'll have better low RPM Performance to a point I mean can't be closed obviously so you'll have a perforated tube so that when the pressure is higher here um it doesn't bulge out in the middle um because that wouldn't be advantageous so this is this is a hairbrain idea I don't know if it'll work at all I don't know if a flexible membrane exists that can withstand like mileage you know if it'll last at all um but uh hey these are experiments right they're not products yet we're just testing stuff out and learning things as we go it would be really cool if you could implement this in the exhaust side as well cuz then if you could restrict the diameter of the intake and the exhaust at the same time at low load low RPM get a pretty efficient engine I think but as for whether you could find a flexible membrane that could withstand exhaust temperatures the jury's out you heard me say it earlier and I'll say it again during the course of project osaki we're going to learn a lot of cool stuff we're going to build a lot of cool stuff and we're going to make sharing good ideas contageous so if you want to learn more about the project check out the links in the video description and until then
