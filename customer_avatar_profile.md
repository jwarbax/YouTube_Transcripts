## PAIN POINTS & FRUSTRATIONS

### **Primary Challenges:**
```yaml
Information_Gap:
  problem: "No existing guides for custom/unique projects"
  impact: "Stuck planning or afraid to start"
  current_solution: "Piece together info from multiple sources"

Validation_Anxiety:
  problem: "Unsure if crazy idea is even feasible"
  impact: "Analysis paralysis or costly mistakes"
  current_solution: "Post on forums and hope for helpful responses"

Fabrication_Roadblocks:
  problem: "Stuck on specific technical challenges"
  impact: "Projects stall for weeks or months"
  current_solution: "Trial and error, YouTube research"

Safety_Uncertainty:
  problem: "Don't know what they don't know about safety"
  impact: "Either over-cautious or dangerously naive"
  current_solution: "Hope for the best, ask friends"

Community_Isolation:
  problem: "Local car scene focuses on standard builds"
  impact: "No peer group for experimental projects"
  current_solution: "Online forums with inconsistent engagement"
```

### **Decision-Making Triggers:**
```yaml
Conversion_Motivators:
  - "Finally, someone who gets experimental builds"
  - "These people have actually built weird stuff"
  - "I can get unstuck without starting over"
  - "Community of people doing similar crazy projects"
  - "Guidance without judgment about 'why would you do that'"

Objection_Patterns:
  - "Is this just another generic car forum?"
  - "Will they understand my specific weird project?"
  - "Are these people qualified to help with custom stuff?"
  - "Can I afford another monthly subscription?"
  - "Will I actually get help or just join another dead community?"
```

## BUYING BEHAVIOR & PREFERENCES

### **Information Consumption:**
```yaml
Content_Preferences:
  primary: "YouTube project documentation videos"
  secondary: "Discord/forum real-time discussions"
  tertiary: "Instagram build progress photos"
  research: "Reddit for community opinions and experiences"

Discovery_Channels:
  - YouTube algorithm recommendations
  - Word-of-mouth from fellow builders
  - Reddit community discussions
  - Instagram hashtag exploration
  - Automotive forum cross-posts
```

### **Value Perception:**
```yaml
Price_Sensitivity:
  - Compares to: "Monthly tool subscriptions, software licenses"
  - Budget_context: "Will spend $200 on project parts without hesitation"
  - Value_equation: "Time saved > Money spent"
  - Comparison_points: "Shop consultation fees ($150/hour)"

Service_Expectations:
  - Wants guidance, not hand-holding
  - Values experience over credentials
  - Expects honesty about feasibility
  - Appreciates "here's how I'd approach it" responses
  - Needs validation that ideas aren't completely insane
```

## COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES

### **Messaging That Resonates:**
```yaml
Effective_Language:
  - "Let's figure out how to make this work"
  - "I've built something similar, here's what I learned"
  - "That's actually not as crazy as it sounds"
  - "Here are three ways you could approach this"
  - "The tricky part will be X, but here's how to handle it"

Messaging_To_Avoid:
  - "You can't/shouldn't do that"
  - "Just buy the kit instead"
  - "That's too dangerous/complicated"
  - "Here's the right way to do it" (implies only one way)
  - "You need professional help for that"
```

### **Preferred Interaction Style:**
```yaml
Communication_Style:
  tone: "Peer-to-peer rather than expert-to-novice"
  approach: "Collaborative problem-solving"
  feedback: "Honest assessment with alternatives"
  support: "Direction and guidance, not step-by-step instructions"
  community: "Experienced builders helping other builders"
```

## SUCCESS METRICS & OUTCOMES

### **Member Success Indicators:**
```yaml
Engagement_Patterns:
  - Asks 2-3 substantial questions per month
  - Shares project progress and learnings
  - Helps other members with similar challenges
  - Completes 1-2 custom projects per year
  - Refers other experimental builders

Value_Realization:
  - "I got unstuck and finished my project"
  - "I avoided a costly mistake with their guidance"
  - "I learned a new technique I can use on future builds"
  - "I found my tribe of people who build weird stuff"
  - "I'm more confident tackling experimental projects"
```

### **Retention Factors:**
```yaml
Keeps_Membership_When:
  - Working on active custom project
  - Getting helpful responses to questions
  - Learning from other members' builds
  - Feels part of community of experimental builders
  - Sees value in knowledge base and past discussions

Cancels_Membership_When:
  - Between projects with no immediate builds planned
  - Community becomes too generic/mainstream
  - Response quality declines or becomes too theoretical
  - Finds alternative community or resource
  - Financial priorities shift
```

## COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE AWARENESS

### **Current Alternatives:**
```yaml
Where_They_Go_Now:
  reddit_r_projectcar: "Some good ideas, lots of noise"
  youtube_tutorials: "Great for specific techniques, not custom guidance"
  local_car_meets: "Standard builds, not experimental friendly"
  facebook_groups: "Hit or miss quality, hard to search"
  professional_shops: "Expensive and often won't touch custom work"

Why_They_Switch_To_You:
  - Focus specifically on custom/experimental projects
  - Experienced builders who've done weird stuff
  - Real-time guidance rather than hoping for forum responses
  - Community that celebrates rather than questions experimental builds
  - One place for all custom project guidance vs scattered resources
```

## AVATAR VALIDATION CRITERIA

### **True Avatar Indicators:**
- Gets excited about projects others call "impossible" or "why would you do that?"
- Has multiple unfinished experimental projects (normal for type)
- Spends more time planning/researching than most people spend building
- Values learning and iteration over quick solutions
- Enjoys explaining their weird projects to others

### **False Positive Indicators:**
- Only interested in proven modifications with kits available
- Wants step-by-step instructions rather than guidance
- Risk-averse or needs guarantees projects will work
- Focuses primarily on resale value or practicality
- Prefers buying solutions over building them
