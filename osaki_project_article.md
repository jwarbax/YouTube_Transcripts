# Project Osaki: Revolutionizing Transportation Through Open Source Design

## The Vision: Affordable, Efficient Transportation for Everyone

What if we could build a car that checks all the boxes: reliable, fuel-efficient, low emissions, and most importantly, affordable? Not just financing-affordable, but truly affordable enough to buy outright. This is the ambitious vision behind Project Osaki, an open source automotive initiative that aims to democratize car ownership and manufacturing.

The current new car market presents a significant barrier to entry, with even the least expensive new vehicles starting around $18,000. For many people, this necessitates financing arrangements that span 4-6 years, after which the vehicle's value has depreciated to roughly a quarter of its original price. Project Osaki challenges this model by creating a completely open source vehicle design that any shop or manufacturing facility can produce.

## The Open Source Advantage

By making all design files freely available under an open source license, Project Osaki removes traditional barriers to automotive manufacturing. Existing shops and facilities can access complete blueprints, modify them for their specific needs, and begin production without licensing fees or proprietary restrictions.

The licensing model encourages innovation while maintaining community benefit. Manufacturers can develop proprietary powertrains or other components while using the open source body design. The only requirement is that improvements to the shared components must be contributed back to the community, creating a cycle of continuous improvement.

## Core Design Philosophy

### Spacious Tandem Seating

The fundamental design philosophy centers on maximizing efficiency while maintaining comfort. Rather than traditional side-by-side seating, Project Osaki employs tandem seating (front-to-back arrangement) to dramatically reduce frontal area. This design choice is based on the aerodynamic drag formula, where reducing frontal area is actually more effective than improving the coefficient of drag (CD).

The design aims for a 35-40% reduction in width compared to conventional cars, maintaining adequate elbow room, leg room, and headroom while achieving the aerodynamic benefits of a narrower profile. This concentrated mass design also reduces weight transfer to tires, allowing for narrower tires that further decrease frontal area and improve fuel efficiency.

### Advanced Suspension and Braking Systems

The vehicle incorporates several innovative chassis technologies:

**Inboard Brake System**: Both front and rear brakes are mounted to the frame rather than within the wheels. This configuration reduces unsprung weight, allows for stationary brake cooling systems, and enables complete wheel sealing to reduce aerodynamic turbulence.

**Modular Suspension Components**: Every corner of the vehicle uses identical components—brake rotors, calipers, axles, spindles, and control arms. This standardization dramatically reduces parts costs and improves availability.

**Inboard Suspension Setup**: Coil springs and shock absorbers are also mounted inboard, further reducing frontal area and unsprung weight for improved ride quality and handling.

## Experimental Powertrain Technologies

Project Osaki embraces hybrid technology as a compromise between environmental consciousness and driving enthusiasm. The initiative includes several innovative powertrain experiments:

### Hybrid Rotary Engine Development

The first major experiment involves converting a 12A rotary engine into a hybrid system by integrating an axial flux electric motor into the intermediate housing. This reluctance-based motor design avoids permanent magnets, eliminating concerns about temperature-related magnetic degradation.

### Single Rotor Efficiency Enhancement

A fascinating approach to addressing the rotary engine's incomplete combustion issues involves using an electric motor to modulate rotor speed during the combustion cycle. By slowing the rotor during the power stroke, the system allows more complete fuel combustion while simultaneously generating electricity to charge the battery.

### Longitudinally Phased Electric Motor

Perhaps the most innovative concept is a revolutionary electric motor design where the phases run longitudinally rather than circumferentially. This configuration allows the upper stator section to fit within a drive shaft tunnel, enabling hybrid conversion of rear-wheel-drive vehicles without floor pan modifications.

## Material Innovation and Manufacturing

The project explores cost-effective manufacturing through innovative materials and processes:

**DIY Fiberglass Infused Thermoplastic**: This experimental material aims to provide inexpensive body panel solutions suitable for small-scale manufacturing.

**Variable Diameter Intake/Exhaust Tubing**: An experimental system using flexible membranes and pressure chambers to optimize airflow for different RPM ranges, potentially improving engine efficiency across the operating spectrum.

## Design Philosophy: Function Meets Form

While aerodynamic efficiency is paramount, Project Osaki recognizes the importance of visual appeal. The design philosophy rejects the purely teardrop-shaped vehicles often seen in concept cars, instead incorporating sharp angles and classic styling elements that make the vehicle visually appealing while maintaining aerodynamic efficiency.

The interior follows a minimalist approach, including only essential components needed for reliable point-to-point transportation. However, the modular design philosophy extends to interior components, allowing other manufacturers to develop and integrate additional technology modules for customers who desire enhanced features.

## The Future of Open Source Automotive Development

Project Osaki represents more than just a single vehicle design—it's a model for collaborative innovation in the automotive industry. By sharing ideas freely and encouraging experimentation, the project aims to accelerate innovation while making transportation more accessible.

The open source model allows for virtually endless variations. Different manufacturers could develop sporty versions, family-oriented configurations, or off-road capable variants, all building on the shared foundation of efficient, affordable design.

## Experimental Approach and Community Learning

It's important to note that Project Osaki embraces an experimental methodology. Not every concept will prove viable, and failure is expected as part of the learning process. The value lies not just in successful products, but in the knowledge gained and shared throughout the development process.

This approach of making idea-sharing "contagious" represents a fundamental shift in how automotive innovation might occur—moving from proprietary, closed development to open, collaborative advancement that benefits the entire community.

## Looking Forward

Project Osaki stands as an ambitious attempt to democratize both car ownership and automotive innovation. By combining open source principles with practical engineering solutions, it offers a glimpse into a future where efficient, affordable transportation is accessible to everyone, and where good ideas can spread freely to benefit the global community.

Whether every experimental component proves successful is less important than the broader mission: proving that open collaboration can drive meaningful innovation in one of the world's most important industries.
