today we are experimenting what are we experimenting with fiberglass and thermoplastic so while this is a first time experiment with trying to create this material in the shape of a mold I do have a little bit of a proof of concept so we're not completely in the dark here I know this works to an extent not to mention the auto industry's been combining thermoplastic and fiberglass for decades the only difference here is I'm trying to bring it to the DIY community so you don't need a $10,000 mold to make use of this cool technology let me show you it all started with this

thing might recognize it it is a t-shirt press check it out so when I was printing the custom ITB intake system for the Miata race car I wasted a $100 roll of carbon fiber nylon filament on this thing which I thought was going to be the final intake manifold print for the car for the system so when that happened I had to buy a new roll of filament to do the job and I was going to buy another roll of carbon fiber nylon but instead I saw carbon fiber polypropylene available and it had the material properties that I needed and it was a little bit less it was actually on sale it was a lot less than the carbon fiber nylon so I sprung for that and boy that was a whirlwind it's such a LoveHate relationship with polypropylene because it's an awesome material I'm not going to get into all the things I love about it um but man it is a nightmare to try to print with it won't stick to the bed well it it will stick to the bed but if it sticks to the bed it'll lift the whole bed up because the only bed materials that are capable of having polypropylene stick to them are polypropylene and polypropylene shrinks a lot when the temperature changes so I needed to make my own build plate with fiberglass in the polypropylene so that it would have some more strength and it wouldn't warp so much when I was trying to print on top of it so that's what I did I got some fiberglass weave that you would normally find at an auto part store or Amazon anything like that and also some of this stuff you might recognize it it might even be under the chair that you're sitting on right now this is 100% polypropylene Fabric and they use it on the bottom of furniture um they use it in like flower beds and stuff to keep the moisture in the soil and it's super cheap and it's super thin so it's easy to melt into other things such as glass so I used my Nifty little uh t-shirt build plate maker right here I went glass or plastic glass plastic smoed her on down and what came out was a nice build plate obviously with a lot more layers than I demonstrated here but this is less than a 16 thick which um I was actually trying to make it a little thicker but I ran out of material and it's it's quite strong it was good enough it it still warped a lot but it was good enough for me to make the intake manifold that I put on the car after a lot of finish work and it's kind of funny um when you peel the part off it actually takes the first layer of plastic off of the build plate so it damages it but it's actually repairable because all you have to do is put it in your trusty little uh t-shirt build plate maker over here and put another layer of plastic down melted in and you got a nice brand new build plate again so we know it works we know it has the capability of being strong but we don't know how easy it is to form into a mold so that's what we're both going to find out right now all right so we have our 3D printed mold that's been prepped and painted um it doesn't have a really good surface finish but we're not too concerned about um the way that the process pulls the detail away from the mold too much at this stage we just want to know how easy it is to work with the material and if the part is capable of coming out strong that's all we want to know this is our soap mold release agent uh good old Kirkland Signature brand there we have our plaster of Paris which should easily be able to withstand the temperature um that this polypropylene melts at so we'll be able to make our mold with this warm it up and hopefully once this sheet of plastic goes down it'll sort of just melt into place and then we can we can layer by layer build up our part and use our little glass spoons to get in the corners and smooth it all out we have both fiberglass get out of there dude we have both fiberglass sheet and fiberglass that's chopped I'm not sure if we'll have enough time to use this material on the video today um but we'll definitely be doing a variety of these um based on the success of this experiment so for today what we're going to be using is this mat which it's quite a lot thicker than I wanted it to be it's going to need a lot of sheets of plastic per sheet of glass um little bit of an oversight on my part but what we need to do right now is weigh everything and determine how many sheets of plastic we're going to use for one sheet of fiberglass and uh determine what kind of ratio we're going to use in the mold as well all right we got our scale set up a trusty little uh Refrigeration charge scale from the uh Subzero repair days and let's first see how much one sheet of glass weighs sorry guys I'm an American but I got to measure in grams right now just because it's a little bit more discreet but I can't say I feel good about it all right 32 Gram on the glass how many sheets of plastic does it take to weigh 30 32 G

five 22 it's eight sheets 34 let's take one off and see what that weighs 30 okay 28 30 we're going to use eight so it'll be close to 50/50 slightly slightly more plastic all right that's good it's for little mold going on there let's just uh I've never made a mold before too so this is see how it goes get some soap in there smear it around this is fun this is yeah smearing soap on a mold 10 out of 10 yeah I would recommend even if you guys don't have a mold to make just get some soap and like shmear it on something that's that's Sensational so now that this is thoroughly

coated going to go ahead and wash my hands wait for that to dry and start mixing some powdery stuff how long does soap take to

[Applause] dry about 5 and 1 half video seconds that's how long all right we got all our junk ready to roll now we need um we need some kind of container to mix this thing in water gallon jug jug of man can I even talk gallon jug of water I think this will be fantastic I'm going to cut it while retaining use of the handle there we go that's where I wanted it to cut yeah

beautiful what do you think of that clean cold water 40 to 50° fah um yeah oh we need a stir stir a stirer let's find one all right we got our stirer got our white powdery stuff and uh I should get like a separate container of water so I could mix it all right right here see I don't think this water is 40 or 50° is the problem seems like maybe maybe 90 maybe maybe 100° all right wait what's what's the ratio sets hard in 20 minutes two parts plaster to one part cold water I don't know I'm just going to wing it who whoa whoa whoa

whoa can you breed this stuff all right here we go there's still like couple little chunks in there all right here goes the

pour this is too thick it's like whipped cream that's cool yeah if you've done plaster before like feel free to make fun of me cuz I have no idea what I'm

doing

all right we'll let it set up and hope uh hope we're going to be all good that's done okay it has been I don't know it's been like an hour so this should be well and dry it says it sets up in 30 minutes and all the crumbling from the inside of the jug seem like they're fully cured so we're going to try to pop this out of the mold and hope it doesn't break cuz I'd be super bummed if it did I don't have any more plaster left see if we can get this off in one piece then it's time to heat it up and uh make a tiny little little Hood guy here we go um should I flip it over or should I break the edges I think I'm going to break the

edges yeah there we go let's just break the break the plastic off of here there we go got some layer Separation on the print perfect oh yeah see how this

looks it doesn't have a great surface finish but it's not broken so we can use this it'll work yeah it's kind

of well the soap released it really well but I think um

some remnants of the soap got left behind and that's what gave us a funky finish let's put this thing on the freaking stove and see if we can get it to 400° start laying some plastic inside of it it's cracked heated it up too fast I knew it was going to happen too um it wasn't completely completely cured there was still moisture in there that turned to steam when I heated it up too fast and popped up through the mold it didn't crack all the way through though so we're still in good shape um problem I'm dealing with right now is the corners don't want to heat up not a surprise there either because the burner is a circle the mold is a square you do the math I wasn't too good in Geometry but I know that circles don't have corners so what I've done is I built up the edges cuz not only is there no direct heat under the corners but the corners are also a lot thicker than the center too um so it's having a hard time moving heat Out The Middle's almost 300 and the corners aren't even they're like 110 um so what I'm going to do is add even more foil I have the corners built up to bring the center away and then hopefully the aluminum can conduct heat a little bit better than the air that's sitting underneath the center of the mold um but it's still not doing the job so I'm going to move this add even more aluminum and hopefully I can turn the heat cuz right now it's you know barely sitting below halfway um so let me move this thing there's still a lot of heat still a lot of steam trapped under this thing too so as you can

see this thing is steaming when you pick it up so I should probably put it in the oven and let it bake all the way through and get it super dry um that way I don't worry about have to worry about how fast I crank the heat up on it but yeah we don't got no time for for that all right let's let this uh heat up for a while I think I can probably add another click a temperature and uh we'll come back to it when it's warm and start laying some sheets on it all right I walked away for like 2 minutes and uh yeah The Middle's 500 and it's smoking so um and I only went up from four to five on the gauge here uh so I turned it back to two um I'm not going to touch it I'm just going to let it do its thing it hasn't cracked which is good so um we're just going to let that sit there hopefully the heat will work its way out and uh I'll come back when it's not smoking and hopefully we can throw some plastic sheets on there all right I didn't want to have to use this cuz it's going to be tedious but hopefully when I heat up the outside surface with this hopefully it'll hold its heat a little bit with and be able to maintain it with a little bit that's coming from from the center so uh let's give this a

shot W I think it just has way too much water still in it CU right now I got it all the way up to 380 boom down to 280 already it loses like 5° a second as soon as you take the heat away so we need to put put this in the oven um it's got to bake for a while to let all that moisture out hopefully it doesn't crack anymore cuz we all we got to this crack opened up a little bit it's gone to the center um and it's sort of branched out so hopefully it's still all in one piece when we take it out of the oven but that's what has to happen so let me set it on the rack with nothing underneath it cuz I'm sure once I lift this up I'll show you right now once I lift this up there's probably a ton of steam trapped underneath um and that's why it's cooling off so fast it's not able to retain that heat look at that freaking steamy McGee over

here so uh yeah

let's let's put it in the oven we won't crank it all the way up we'll put it in it's so holding together pretty well has some strength to it we'll leave it in there

at um I don't know let's say uh 250 all right we're going to have to let that go for a while probably eat some dinner um since the stove is no loer occupied and we'll be back at it okay a day has passed this thing was in the oven for about an hour yesterday at 250 so that dried it out Prett pretty thoroughly there wasn't a whole lot of steam coming out anymore after that I've been slowly warming it up throughout the morning and the crack is definitely bigger I think the thing shrunk as the water content left you know as it finished its curing process so I'm hoping it doesn't break into two pieces when I take it out and move it onto our stove top which I'm going to turn on right now leave it at three 3 and A2 polypropylene melts at about 320° we have the mold set to 400 hopefully the burner is able to maintain that temperature and we're going to start laying some plastic down see what happens let's go so we already know dang is that smoke I think it's the oil I soaked it in we already know we have to improve our mold making and also our heating process because oh yeah it might break when I pick it

up see what happens happens here we just need a proof of

concept all righty oh crap the foil's moving around okay all right I think we're I think we're okay let's lay this down see see what

happens here we

go is it going to melt oh it's shrinking it looks crazy yeah it's not it's not melting very uniform it is not melting very uniform let me put two down at once and see if hopefully we can get a little bit of uniform melting going on the heat gun wouldn't be good in this situation I've already tried when I was making the build plate um and the air that's coming out of the heat gun it blows the the sheet of uh fabric around too much and doesn't let it doesn't let it melt uniform that way either so this is it's not melting as quick as I thought it was going to well that's not working it's not hot enough it might need the pressure too it worked so well on that um T-shirt press I think because of the constant pressure that was being applied to it it melted really uniform this is not melting uniform at all it's it's not really even melting it's kind of sticking too yeah see it's not

really it's not really melting at all Smokey we're past the melting point of the plastic in a few places so it's producing smoke and uh that's probably not great to breathe polyprop is non-toxic but I wouldn't recommend burning it and inhaling the smoke I had a little bit of success once I put all four sheets of plastic down put the fiberglass on top of it and then I started applying heat with the heat gun because the fiberglass was in the way it was limiting the turbulence that the air was um producing coming out of the heat gun and it started melting it started creating a little bit of a form but I still had an issue with the plastic not melting in a uniform way so it kind of Globs up and clumps and rolls into different directions so there's no uniformity here um in the fiberglass itself so I'm going to approach this a different way um I'm going to let this cool off so I could peel it off in one piece and reset and what I think might produce a better result is if we pre um fabricate the sheets with the plastic and fiberglass together in the T-shirt press since this is too thick I'm going to go in there I'm going to use the chopped fiberglass um with uh maybe four sheets of this plastic um and melt all that together that'll be uniform and still thin I'll put those on layer by layer um and then hopefully as I apply heat to it it'll sort of since it's a homogeneous sheet of plastic rather than a fabric with like perforations in it um hopefully it'll deflect and start to warp and then sink into all the corners as more and more heat is applied to it so going to go out there make some pre-fabricated sheets um and see if that works let's do it okay this thing takes quite a while to warm up um generally with these you only need this to get hot because that's what pushes the pattern into the shirt that you're printing on uh but in our case we need this to be nice and hot too so I'll normally uh close it let's see where it's set to 120 seconds okay so I'll let it get hot and then I'll close it try to get some heat into this aluminum plate um oh that reminds me um it likes to stick to this it's better if I put a piece of glass down be right back all right so while that's warming up we'll have time to clean this glass off and determine how much of this we need for each sheet of that so let's remind ourselves what two sheets of this

weighs eight eight grams what does eight gram of this look like that's not even one

10 that says

eight we'll go with it um so now I'll just keep measuring it each time that way I get the same amount so let's say that's up to 212 get some heat in the aluminum clean this up and I will see you once this is all ready to go and I'll show you what it's like when we slap the plastic in there and see if a nice sheet comes out I've never used the chopped glass um in this machine so it's probably going to be difficult to try to arrange this in a uniformly chaotic way um so that'll be interesting okay our glass is possibly melting our bucket this thing's ready to go there's one all right now let oh I didn't think that through did I let's put this

here okay sprinkle that on

there it's not very much is it okay how do I disperse this evenly this is not a simple task is it okay that is not uniform at all but um we're going to send it just to see what happens put our glass back on

top loosen this a little bit cuz it's a little too tight and oh hey let's slide that in okay see what happens I think what I need to do let me weigh eight more grams

out okay um after I weigh the the toe or chopped fiberglass I think I need to go in there and and break all these up cuz they're kind of clumped together I think I need to to break them into like smaller fibers there's eight um before I spread it out cuz if you can see they're kind of clumped you have like clumps of very tiny fibers so I think I need to go in there and break them all up like this so that when I put them on the sheet there's more of them to spread around so while that's going I'll do this there we go think this next one will be better I'm going to do one more of these with the toe see if I can get it distributed a little e more evenly um and then after that I'm going to try one with the sheet it's going to be a lot thicker um but uh we should at least try it out while this thing's hot um cuz the uniformity might be a problem with this process all right how's this one going to

look melted

there's not enough

plastic it's not enough

plastic it's melting all crazy a it looks terrible under there see what we have here oh yeah hot mess that's fantastic okay you know what it didn't get hot enough on the aluminum so let me

let me wipe this and get some more heat in the

aluminum this probably would have looked better if I left it on there longer but there's clearly not enough plastic uh in the mix so this chopped carbon chopped uh fiberglass stuff

uh it's not going to be the winning solution maybe for a machine but certainly not for

me okay once that's warm um I'm going to do four sheets of plastic one sheet of the glass mat another four sheets of plastic that should be enough for it to fully melt in it's going to be a lot thicker than I want it to be but um in the future we'll get some glass mat that's thinner than this I thought this was the thinnest one you could get when I ordered it but uh that can't be true there's got to be thinner stuff um get thinner glass and uh we'll go at this again see if we can improve the result with a better mold as well that's the painful thing about working with polypropylene is if there's like a little bit of residue left over um after you're done it's like completely impervious to chemicals so you can't clean it off with acetone or soap and water acid like nothing eats the stuff it just stays on there forever you have to melt it off which is great it's really uh it's really tough stuff as it comes to uh chemical susceptibility but uh makes it really hard to clean all right see what it looks like yeah that's fully melted so we're going to go ahead and let this cool off and once that's cold we can remove it from the plate we'll head back inside and see if it melts into the mold I'm really pleased with the way the molten plastic wet out and melted into the fibers in this mat because when I was working with the fiberglass weave to make the build plate all those ders were wound tightly together and it was hard for that plastic to work its way in between them so it looks like this is going to work pretty well all right we got our sheets made up um very timec consuming process you have to let the T-shirt press warm up a lot before you can melt the plastic then you have to let it completely cool down so you can separate it without having a Oozy mess so we have three sheets um we were surprised by some pretty good news um when this was all assembled together it ended up being a lot thinner than I thought it was going to be so just one of these sheets is 25,000 so we're going to put three of them together um and that'll give us 75,000 um of thickness which should be enough to demonstrate its ability to keep its shape when we put some force on it I reduced the amount of plastic sheets uh per fiberglass sheet from 8 to six and um after doing that I weight it again um and come to find out maybe the other weight measurement wasn't very accurate because with six sheets of plastic and one sheet of fiberglass we have an exact 50% um ratio between the two so this has been on for a little while it's warming up had to put foil down all over the mold because of the crack and then also when the plastic cooled down and I I tried to remove it uh from our failed attempt earlier it pulled pieces of the plaster off and I didn't want to have to worry about damaging the part once it cooled off so it's not pretty but that's okay we just need a proof of concept for today and that'll be a super big win we've already learned a lot and um we I mean this is a proof of concept in itself so we're on the right track if we can get it to form into something we're going to be doing super good so let's this is a heat gun uh assembly technique so just going to lay this in there some H they kind of curled up a bunch trying to peel them off of the glass so they don't have the flattest shape but um here we go this is actually looking pretty good I'm going to try to get a closeup of

this

all right the first layer has been melted down um not perfectly there's a couple things that are happening so the aluminum is providing a little bit of spring back um which isn't good it's not letting it lay down all the way also I think there's an interference happening with the glue that's in the fiberglass mat as well there's glue that holds all the FI fibers together that's designed to dissolve in the epoxy resin that you use to lay it up there's a chemical reaction that takes place when you put the resin on it and it breaks down that glue and allows the fibers to to move around and conform to the Contours of the piece or the mold that you're making it doesn't feel like the the glass fibers are moving around very well they're kind of trying to fold back and I don't think it's all the aluminum that's uh creating that to happen uh I also noticed when I made these um they were sticking to the glass which it never did before when I made the build plate with the fiberglass weave that doesn't have any glue in it and the pure polypropylene sheets it did not stick to the glass at all it popped right off and this thing that's why they're so curled I had to scrape at it a bunch with the putty knife um and it even left residue behind on the glass so I think that glue is not breaking down um I'm going to lay the second one down right on top and hope that it melts into this first layer and we'll go from

there

I think that's as good as I can get it by hand uh um so let's cool this thing off and see what it looks like cool so a few months ago I had a really big Revelation and in that moment I decided that I want to share all of my closely held ideas with you guys on YouTube rather than build individual businesses around them because I just have two many ideas for one person to pursue in a single Lifetime and I think everybody can benefit from them so this project today is going to be the first open source development process on the Channel with many more to come so if you're an engineer or a mechanic and you want to offer your time and energy to the cause I'm putting my contact details down in the video description below so get in touch with me and if you're just a casual Observer that's into science and cars there's a membership promo video that you can watch if you click the join button down below and that'll give you an opportunity to support us financially as we put our good ideas and the bad ideas through the development process so that hopefully all of us can benefit from the knowledge that we gain along the way so with that let's see how this part came out well it's not pretty but it's pretty strong and um it feels kind of light um let's wait it come in at 172 gam and we determined that the thickness should be 75,000 assuming everything fused together which it didn't we have certain bubbles where not all the layers melted into each other completely but this is a proof of concept concept as far as I'm concerned the question of is this worth developing further I say yes I think there's really something here um I haven't gone inside to do the math but I'm going to put up on screen here how much this piece cost so I wanted to go over these prices with you personally instead of just throwing the numbers up on screen so we're only comparing the cost of the polypropylene fabric to the epoxy resin that is traditionally used we're ignoring the cost of fiberglass because that's going to be the same either way I spent $4.40 on the plastic used in today's experiment if I bought a larger batch of polypropylene I would have spent $160 on today's experiment with resin the cost would have been $2 and then with a larger batch of resin today's cost would have been $150 now the large batch of resin cost $242 while the large batch of polypropylene only cost $80 so there's a little bit of a smaller barrier to entry for getting the discount on the polypropylene compared to the resin but without doing a lot more market research and shopping it looks like the cost between the two materials is roughly the same so the main benefit of continuing development on this process is going to be the convenience and added speed you get by not having to wait for resin to cure and being able to use the thermoplastic as soon as it cools off I think there's a lot of potential with this and uh we learned a lot I learned a little bit about mold making um you have to cure the plaster quite a bit more make sure it's completely dry before you heat it up and beyond that the plastic sticks to the plaster and pulls it up so you can't use that as the surface of the mold so I'm thinking we might have to make the mold out of aluminum um but let me know what you guys think uh you've seen you've got the information that I've attained from this process and uh let me hear what your guys ideas are for the mold process the mold manufacturing process uh what materials we should use um whether an integrated heater you think would be a good idea with plaster if we should use silicone on top if we should go with aluminum um all these things let me know so with that I hope you enjoyed and watch another video before you go
