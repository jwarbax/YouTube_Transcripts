so crazy story right a month ago I was a dude in a garage with a camera talking about this crazy open- Source car project and here we are 30 days later we have 22 developers in the Discord Channel many of whom are accomplished engineers and talented designers students looking to learn um and all people that I have personally talked to and placed in the channel so that we can develop together the channel has been private up until today at which point I'll be making it public but hold your horses we'll get into that a little bit later cuz I have a lot of cool stuff that I want to share with you in this video so let's get right into it so the first order of business is the idea that generated both the most love and the most hate which is to be expected cuz we're talking about the rotary engine specifically this intermediate housing that I want to make into a reluctance machine so let's talk about that for a minute let's talk about choices right so in this development process there's many choices that we're going to have to make and compromises we're going to have to make we want to always pick the best path forward with the resources we have available to us and for me right now that's very limited resources which is why we're starting with this rotor engine to begin with because it was a non-essential engine that I had lying around that was running and in good shape but it might turn out to be a blessing because there's some pretty cool advantages to the rotary engine namely its size and power to weight ratio so before I get into all the technical details of the design that I intend for this machine I want to let you guys know that we're not actually going to be performing this experiment ourselves for this project osaki I'm sorry to tell you that especially those of you who are really excited about this particular project but I do have good news for you there is a race team in belgum called just cell racing they love the idea of this project and they want to build a prototype themselves and we're going to help them do it so I am going to show you and them what I intend to do to engineer this thing and we're going to cover their experiments and experiences as they build their prototype of this intermediate crazy radio flux motor monstrosity the reason I'm not going to do it for project osaki is because there's just a huge heat issue um and I don't think it's going to be the best use of my time since the focus is on price and economy um this is going to be an expensive project to perform all in itself and it's when it's all done it's not going to be a cheap engine to put in a car so it kind of defeats the purpose of what we're trying to do which is build something affordable but for a race team it's a perfect project more power um crazy experiments get to learn a bunch of cool stuff I think it's a perfect fit for you guys that just sell racing and I'm really excited that you reached out to me and uh yeah I'm happy to uh happy to build this thing with you help out any way I can all right so here's our intermediate housing um it's iron which is bad for flux uh this would be better if it was aluminum um which I think they're planning to do which is awesome um because what happens is when you have the iron on the outside or you know all about in the case that you know it is right now it's going to mess with the flux path and you're not going to get a lot of torque into the rotor because the magnetic flux is going to want to go through the housing rather than the rotor and it's not going to produce much torque by doing that so if this was all aluminum it'd be much better um short of that I pictured cutting this whole Center section out because there is oil that goes through the inside of here you have oil galys and oil sloshing around and oil being spr braid from The Eccentric shaft into the center of the rotor as it rotates and you have water going along the outside of this now there are certain places you can cut in certain places you can't um and by trying to introduce four Stater cores into the housing itself you're producing a lot of possibilities for leaks oil leaks and water leaks water into oil oil into water yada yada yada you get the picture so I pictured cutting this whole Center section out and replacing it with like a magnetic Stater assembly um with aluminum on each side and your stator cores you know kind of where the Sharpie marks are here that you can see so I am going to draw up a quick little CAD file and give you a better visual representation of what I'm talking about all right guys here's our intermediate housing we have North Pole magnets on one side South Pole magnets on the other side these are electromagnets obviously they're not permanent magnets and let's bring up some rotors so we could see see how they work one rotor two rotor three rotor party okay enough of that so as the top and bottom Stater cores activate the rotor will be in this position so at 12:00 and 6:00 the North Pole will go through the rotor through the Ecentric shaft and then back out of the other rotor on the opposite side to the South Pole at the bottom so these the top and bottom will be in series and the left to right cores will be in series as well um those will activate as the rotor rotates a little bit to line itself up with those it'll be the same type of configuration Heat's going to be a big issue with this so let me make these invisible again so we can go in here uh this is all Hollow this is an oil bath on the inside of here um I think we should have oil squirters pointing at all of the different Stater cores to try to at least keep them as cool as the oil is um and uh just constantly keep spraying them with an oil bath uh because they're going to produce some heat yeah it's Heat's going to be an insane challenge you'll probably need quite a hefty oil cooling setup in order to keep this engine cool um one potential good thing I don't know how much of a good thing it really is um but one of the problems with rotary engines is they're mostly only hot on one side because they have all the exhaust is happening down here and all the intakes happening up here so the top half of the housing is a lot cooler than the bottom half of the housing so being as you're going to be pouring so much heat into the center housing um you'll kind of more evenly distribute the heat through the engine possibly I don't know if that'll lead to any benefit uh usually more heat is a bad thing in all cases but uh ah it's something to um think about I guess I'm not smart enough to know what kind of implications that might have with the heat being more evenly distributed but it'll be uh it'll be an interesting test so you might be wondering Warner dude if you're not going to build the hybrid rotary engine that you were going to whatever will you do we are going to build a hybrid rotary engine and that is why I've loaded up my wife's baby blue bug with a bunch of rotary junk for measurement purposes we're going to drive it 5 hours away and meet one of our valuable contributors on the development team bring this Ecentric shaft over to them cut it in half going to take this extra lobe off so that it's not spinning all that unnecessary weight we're going to take our bearing surface move it down to somewhere in here so we can eliminate the intermediate housing and the second rotor housing and uh yeah remove three combustion Chambers and save fuel in the process along with a bunch of extra weight then we're going to take the electric motor an external electric motor of known performance values put it on the outside and get our hybrid assist that way all right so it's late I have a long drive ahead of me tomorrow if you haven't noticed we have new project project osaki t-shirts available download reliable carzip project osaki in the back wonderful conversation starter for your friends so you can share the project with them hopefully they can get involved too uh check out the shirt while I rest and first thing in the morning we're going to drive 5 hours out to Arizona and ruin a perfectly good engine in the name of science all right folks allow me to introduce you to the former Global vice president of engineering at GKN Aerospace and more recently the director of engineer ing at Nicola Motor Company Mark Bunion he nice to meet him nice to meet you good to finally put a name to the face absolutely ni it's great to see you so what would make a person as reputable and having as many accolades as you do be interested in such a silly project as mine well the thing that you've got on your hand so this I've been working on a DIY project to form metals and Plastics with a little desktop machine when I saw you make this I thought ah this could be a product so this project looked like fun and um so far the team has just been amazing the of Interest has been phenomenal the amount of support and interest from everybody has been great so looking forward I'm glad to get my hands on this this composite sheet that Mark has in his hand is part of an experiment that I'm performing of which I already have a video out on the topic check up in the corner if you want to learn more about that and I will be continuing to produce some developments in this area because I think this could potentially be a good good candidate for how we're going to make the body panels for project osaki so what you say we get the uh rotary junk out of the car and see if we can either ruin it or maybe make it better think let's get go so here we have all of our rotary components laid out on the table I had planned to take this Ecentric shaft here and Mark and I were going to turn it down on his lathe but we got to talking and we got to assembling and theorizing and spinning around this little Dorito shaped triple combustion chamber and this is what we came up with I came over here with the full intention of ruining this perfectly good Ecentric shaft in the name of Science and um thankfully we had a smart person in the room and he's convinced me otherwise so instead of doing all this Machining and taking off a huge lobe trying to recreate the taper down here so that we can eliminate the intermediate shaft and the second rotor housing and then do these threads and this wood roof key slot um instead of doing all that stuff which would take forever and we don't currently have the tooling required to do it um and it would probably still need a second machine shop to do the the final pass on the bearing surfaces um we're just going to put it back together the way it was with one of the rotors disabled so you'll just have to pretend that there's a second rotor in place I forgot to bring the other one with me um and what I planned on doing to disable this second rotor is to just remove it completely and block whatever oil gals are present so it's not spraying oil all over the place and I thought that was going to be a good idea but we consulted our rotary Sensei and he advised against that because that would I just clocked the gears on that that would totally throw off the balance of the engine because the Ecentric shaft and the two rotors are designed to be in balance with each other and if I just removed one it would probably vibrate so with this second inactive rotor being in place we have the issue of compression that Mark realized we consulted our rotary Guru once more and he advised us to just remove the Apex seals it won't generate any compression and we won't lose torque we still have the extra inertia from the rotor that we have to move as it goes but it's nothing that can be done about that cuz that very inertia is what's keeping the system in Balance so as crushed as I am personally that we're not going to be cutting into stuff and and taking it beyond the point of repair uh we made pretty good progress today you know knowledge wise and we have a direction to go and being as we don't have to do this there's no mistakes that can be made and uh we'll have a working engine with a electric motor you know doing electric motor stuff sooner than we would have if we started you know butchering this thing to all get out so you could have the engine running yeah without the electric motor just run it on the single cyer exactly I can I can put this back together uh install it in the car and get it running and then see what kind of electric motor we're going to use so I guess all there is left to do is uh load this stuff back up and start putting it together at home yeah smart freaking guy that Mark is we are eliminating non-essential experiments so that we can focus on essential experiments it's a darn good thing guys like him are on the team uh cuz if it's just up to me I'm like cut it off see if it still works so yeah that one-day trip out to Arizona even though we didn't cut anything might have saved us months of wasted effort thank you Mark thank you akihi I'm sorry for saying your name wrong I'm trying my best here so in order for me to write legibly I have to write terribly slow so I'm just going to skip forward to when I have things on this board that we can look at Miata dudes I have some good news on the intake system development a dude reached out to me by the name of Blake mccon who is a Miata Enthusiast in addition to wanting to support project osaki that we're working on right now and him and I are going to be putting our heads together to figure out what we need to do to test this Miata intake system and get it completed and ready to download or purchase or whatever the case may be and on top of that he's a really awesome dude that sells custom Miata products on his website MCC performance I've attached a link down in the video description below so go check out his stuff if you have a Miata and uh help support this project and his business so as you can see my words aren't all that much more legible if I do take my time but I think we'll be able to read it so we have a Bonafide to-do list in a direction to go now uh first we pull the blown engine out of the Mercedes uh there's a fun fact about that engine so when that thing exploded threw a rod through the oil pan leaked oil all over the ground that thing was still running when I pulled it over it was sitting shaking itself to pieces and I had to shut it off manually so that it could finally have its final resting place so if that story is not a testament to Mercedes diesel engine robustness I don't know what is so we pull that junk out of there and then we can start assembling our 6A Road peripheral port engine um with one dead rotor we're going to take the Apex seals as I already said out of the Dead rotor so it's not producing compression as it spins um we have to make manifolds because now we have a peripheral Port um the yeah the exhaust manifold super big and heavy and ugly so we'll need to make two new ones um the exhaust we'll need a O2 sensor because we're going to fuel injection then we'll need a fuel injector port for the intake side as well um a lot of people are under the impression that a peripheral port won't run well at low RPM um and I believe you're under that impression because generally when you go to peripheral Port you put a big old huge intake um diameter on that Port the reason for doing this is usually for racing and for racing you want all your performance at the top end the thing is the port doesn't have to be that big you can restrict the diameter so it can still operate well at low RPM and mid RPMs um but uh this isn't going to going to be a race engine so we can restrict that diameter a little bit it'll still have good chamber filling at low and mid RPM and I expect um if we do a little bit of math and flow analysis it'll still operate well at low RPM plus we're going to have an electric motor that's assisting it at low RPM so I think it'll be a nice little combination sourcing the ECU will be challenging um I don't know if there's any off-the-shelf ecus that are programmed to run single rotor wankle engines um so that might be a bit of difficulty we might have to do some custom stuff I don't really know that'll be challenging it'll also be fun so seals and bearings last time this engine was taken apart which you know this engine's only run maybe two 3 hours since the seals were changed um so those Apex seals and side seals should be pretty fresh the only thing I don't know is if you change the orientation of them or if you change them from one corner to the other if you're going to create a catastrophic wear pattern in the housing I'm not really sure um it might be worth it to change the seals except that I can't really afford to change the seals right now so my options are to put it back the way it is which is probably fine the only thing I don't know is if the bearings are fresh um so that's a question they don't look very fresh so changing the bearings at a minimum would probably be a good idea um or putting it all back together the way it is the other option is if any of you watching have access to some Apex seals that you might be willing to to donate to the cause I would be greatly appreciative of that um and it would really help like peace of mind with putting this thing together and knowing that it's going to work and run properly so I'd be Beyond appreciative if any of you had access to some seals that you'd like to donate it'd make a huge difference for us after seals and bearings uh we just install the thing with the transmission um we're just using the factory transmission that thing's still good I'll probably put a new clutch disc on it um put that back in the car and then we can install a motor on the nose of The Eccentric shaft to help it um be more efficient so the interesting thing about the motor is we want to time the pulses based on the angle of the rotor in the engine so I don't know if we can make an off-the-shelf electric motor control system do that if it can speak to the the sensor on the engine ECU you know the one that's getting the reading off of the trigger wheel to know where the engine is um I don't know if they can they can talk to each other that way um so the control system between the electric motor and the ECU um is going to be like I said here probably one of the most challenging components but probably one of the most fun too so on the motor I wanted to use a golf cart motor um like a powerful golf cart motor I was hoping for at least 30 horsepower but that's just a little bit beyond what most of the even most powerful golf cart motors produce maybe they can in short intervals with enough amperage but then we're limited by the battery pack which is something I forgot to write on here which leads me to my point of wanting to use a golf cart motor is they're designed for a 48volt architecture normally which is a nice safe architecture I think perfect for a DIY project just because it's much less lethal to make your own battery pack or do DIY stuff with lower voltages than it is to do it with higher voltages when you're working with 600 volts DC or and anything over 200 200 volts it's a little sketchy so any time spent learning how to make low voltage systems do what we want them to do and perform well I think it's time well spent um that's not to say we that the only 48 volt Motors are golf cart motors um there might be something a little bit more powerful that works with low voltage that we'll find um but uh you know cost is a big factor as well so once that's done all it's left to do is get all the old diesel out of there and fill it with gas rotor engines run on pretty low octane fuel so I'm not too concerned about like residual diesel on the walls like having to scrub it all out or anything like that if it was a high performance engine that ran on high octane definitely I wouldn't want any diesel in there at all um but this this engine runs on premix for goodness sake I think a little bit of diesel left over probably won't do much harm think it'll just chew it up and spit it out so yeah this is man this is really exciting stuff guys so many of you have reached out I was I was overwhelmed I did not expect this much success from the first video I published the first project osaki video a month ago and my initial plan was to publish another full length video maybe a week or maybe two weeks after that but that video had so much success and I had so many people to reach out to and put in the Discord Channel as developers and developers to talk to inside of the Discord Channel and all of this planning and organizing to do around the project itself to make sure that it's healthy um and that as it moves forward it doesn't get k iotic and kind of you know segmented and break off and US lose focus on what the goals are there's been so much going on behind the scenes it's taken this long to produce the second video um but as more big brains bigger than mine come into the project to help me keep everything organized I should be able to publish on a better schedule going forward but man you guys you guys are awesome you guys are so cool in the comments too like just there's been so much interaction from the first video and um yeah I thank thank you like thank you from the bottom of my heart like this is this is awesome this is really cool if you want to be on the Discord Channel as a developer it's it's public now you can go down on the link you can click it you can join in view everything we're talking about but if you want to be a developer on the project check out my website where you can submit a form um in that form you're going to get a questionnaire emailed out to you and then fill out the questionnaire so that we can learn a little bit about you have some data uh to talk about when we schedule our call and then either myself or one of the team members that's responsible for the you know specific arm of the project that you might have experience or expertise in we'll reach out to you have a personal call it's not don't think of it like an interview it's really chill we're just trying to get to know each other um satisfy your Curiosities if you have some questions about the project that you un answered um we'll be there to answer those questions then we'll put you into the server as a developer and then you can contribute to all the different channels that are in there I kind of split up my content strategy recently so all of the short form content is now going to live on Instagram because it gives me a little bit more time uh to you know provide information YouTube shorts are limited to 60 seconds and there's only so much you can say in 60 seconds so if you want more regular smaller updates head on over to Instagram understand racing um and all of my long form content is going to live here on YouTube and uh yeah you know where to find me so stay tuned for the next video where we're going to be pulling that engine out putting this engine together and seeing what we learn about our control systems see you there
